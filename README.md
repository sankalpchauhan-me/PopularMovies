# Pop Movies
## NOTE
To successfully run the project place The Movie DB API key inside gradle.properties in THE_MOVIE_DB_API_KEY variable

This was my submission for Udacity ADND 
- Used Android Architecture Pattern LiveData, ViewModel & Room, to minimize API calls and to survive configuration changes
- Retry Mechanism, in case first api hit fails, the app will make upto 3 attempts to hit the endpoint.
- Caching Mechanism, provides limited results even when app is offline
- Share feature for movies
= Performed Lint Check
